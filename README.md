# Crystals Collector

The crystals collector game uses a computer generated number which the user has to match by clicking the crystals on the page.

### Usage

* The computer starts once the page gets loaded and restarts after the player won or lost.  A new generated number will be displayed on the page.

### Rules

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
